🔹 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing an e-commerce business dataset to extract meaningful insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, product trends, and city-level revenue distribution. The analysis was carried out using Python for data exploration, SQL for business-driven queries, and a structured dataset representing real-world e-commerce transactions.

🔹 Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – Data cleaning, exploration, and visualization

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL compatible) – Business analysis queries

Jupyter Notebook – Python analysis workflow

CSV Dataset – Transaction-level e-commerce data

🔹 Dataset Description

The dataset contains detailed information about e-commerce orders, including:

Order ID and Order Date

Customer City

Product Name and Category

Quantity and Price

Customer Ratings

Platform Information

This dataset enables both operational and strategic business analysis.

🔹 Python Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Using Python, the following tasks were performed:

Data cleaning (handling null values, formatting columns)

Revenue calculation using quantity × price

Exploratory analysis of:

Sales trends

City-wise performance

Product and category-level insights

Visualizations to represent revenue distribution, order trends, and customer activity

🔹 SQL Analysis (Business Queries)

SQL was used to answer real-world business questions, such as:

Total number of orders placed on the platform

Total revenue generated across all orders

Top 5 cities by:

Number of customer ratings

Total revenue generated

Average order value (AOV) by city

Most popular product category in each city (using window functions)

Top revenue-generating product categories

Highest-rated and most frequently rated products

Recent orders and high-value transactions

These queries demonstrate aggregation, filtering, grouping, ordering, and window functions, reflecting practical analytics use cases 

E-Commerce

🔹 Key Insights Generated

Identified high-revenue cities contributing most to overall sales

Determined top-performing product categories based on revenue

Analyzed customer rating patterns across products and platforms

Measured average order value to understand purchasing behavior

Highlighted city-wise category preferences for targeted marketing

🔹 Outcome

This project showcases the ability to:

Translate raw e-commerce data into actionable business insights

Use Python for data analysis and SQL for analytical querying

Work with real-world datasets in an end-to-end analytics workflow
