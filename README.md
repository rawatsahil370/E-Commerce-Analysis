<h2><a class="anchor" id="business-problem"></a>Business Problem</h2>

E-commerce businesses generate large volumes of transactional data but often struggle to convert this data into actionable insights.
  - This project aims to answer key business questions such as:
  - Which cities and product categories generate the highest revenue?
  - Who are the most valuable customers?
  - What are the sales trends and customer behavior patterns?
  - Which product categories are most popular across regions?

<h2><a class="anchor" id="Python"></a>Python Analysis (Jupyter Notebook)</h2>

Python is used in this project to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization. Using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the dataset is processed to handle missing values, remove inconsistencies, and prepare the data for analysis. Visualizations are created to identify trends in sales, customer behavior, ratings, and category performance, helping to transform raw data into clear and actionable insights.

---

<h2><a class="anchor" id="sql"></a>SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)</h2>

SQL is used to extract meaningful insights from the dataset through structured queries and aggregations. The SQL scripts focus on identifying top-performing cities, high-revenue product categories, valuable customers, and overall sales contributions. By using GROUP BY, JOIN, ORDER BY, and ranking queries, this analysis simulates real-world business questions commonly asked in data analyst roles.
